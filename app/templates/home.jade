				p You're probably used to equations like $$(t-.5)(t-1)= 0,$$ where 'solving' means finding an unknown <em>number</em>. A differential equation (DE), by contrast, is a fact about the derivative of an unknown <em>function</em>, and 'solving' one means finding a function that fits.
				p To visualize derivatives, we can draw a right <span class='col tri'>triangle</span> whose hypoteneuse is tangent to a function. If the triangle's width is $1$, then its <span class='col dv'>height</span> is the derivative.
				p With that one weird trick, the plots to the right show how the derivative of <span class='col v'>$\sin(t)$</span> is <span class='col dv'>$\cos(t)$</span>. Thus, $y(t)=\sin(t)$ is a solution to $$ \dot y = \cos(t).$$ 
				p That's a pretty basic DE, though. You could have solved it just by integrating $\cos(t)$. Now let's look at a more complicated one.

				p Consider a cart rolling to a stop. Its motion obeys the DE $$ \dot{v} = -k \cdot v, $$ where $v$ is velocity, $\dot{v}$ is the rate-of-change of velocity and $k$ is a '<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient'>drag coefficient.</a>' Basically, the faster the cart goes, the faster it slows down.
				p The solution is a function $v(t)$ giving velocity at time $t$. Suppose $k=.8$ and that the cart starts rolling at time $t=0$ at velocity $2$. Then we want a $v(t)$ for which $\dot{v}= -.8v$ and $v(0)=2$.
				p It turns out the exponential function, $e^{-kt}$, has the properties $$ \begin{align} \frac{d}{dt}e^{-kt}=-ke^{-kt} && e^{-k\cdot 0}=1.\end{align}$$ Thus, if $v(t)=2e^{-.8t}$, then $\dot{v}=-.8v$ and $v(0)=2$. Solved!

					| To make the solution more intuitive, here you'll solve the cart's DE manually by picking a series of <span class='col v'>$\left( t, v \right)$</span> points. The points that you choose get strung together into a function <span class='col v'>$v(t)$</span>. At each point, the derivative <span class='col dv'>$\dot{v}$</span> of is calculated and the corresponding point <span class='col dv'>$( v, \dot{v})$</span> shows up on the lower chart. Notice that if you choose pairs along <span class='col real '>$2e^{-.8t}$</span>, then the $(v, \dot {v})$ points wind up around the line <span class='col real-two'>$\dot{v} = -.8v$</span>. 
				p
					| The first cart below obeys the $v(t)$ function you designed. The second obeys $v(t)=2e^{-.8t}$. If you draw $v(t)$ correctly, both cars move together. <span class='col grey'>Grey lines</span> indicate  locations sampled every half-second. If the carts move in tandem they'll line up.

			| We've just scratched the surface here. Differential equations are indispensable tools for understanding everything from ecology, to economics to jet engines. They can involve fifth derivatives or derivatives of more than one variables (partial differential equations).
